# BEAT Windows preview

This is the first runnable Windows prototype in a fork of [BEAT](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat), created by Lauri-Matti Parppei and contributors. The original macOS/iOS app remains in the parent repository. This port is licensed under GPL v3 or later; see ../LICENSE.md.

## Run the packaged app

Double-click `Launch BEAT Windows.cmd` in the `BEAT Windows-win32-x64` folder. The launcher grants Electron's Windows sandbox read/execute access to this application folder, then starts `BEAT Windows.exe`. Keep the executable alongside all the other files in that folder. Preferences and browser session data are kept in a local `user-data` folder. No Node installation is needed for the packaged app. This is an unsigned development build.

## Run from source

Requires Node.js 22 or newer and npm.

```powershell
cd E:\_CONTENT\DEV\BEAT\upstream\windows
npm install
npm start
```

`npm run build` compiles the application; `npm test` runs document/parser tests; `npm run test:desktop` exercises the real Electron application; `npm run package` makes a portable Windows x64 application folder.

Alternatively, run `& .\scripts\test-desktop.ps1` from PowerShell to run the desktop checks, wait for completion, and print their results. The test window briefly opens and types into disposable documents under `work/desktop-test`; it never writes to the upstream sample scripts.

## Available

- New, open, save and save as using native Windows dialogs.
- UTF-8 Fountain files, source newline style and BOM preservation.
- Basic live screenplay formatting with source markup visible.
- Scene/section outline, filtering, synopsis display and navigation.
- Undo/redo, find/replace, dark/light themes and focus mode.
- Unsaved-change prompts and detection of externally changed files before overwriting.
- Existing BEAT metadata documents open read-only and round-trip intact. File > Create editable copy creates a new Fountain-only document; the copy omits BEAT metadata and must be saved under another filename.

## Current limits

This is a writing prototype, not a feature-complete replacement for macOS BEAT. The parser implements a basic subset and has not been compared against output from the native BEAT parser. Markup is visible. Full inline emphasis, complex inline/multiline notes, true dual-dialogue layout, autocomplete, scene reordering, pagination, PDF/FDX export, revisions, tags, plugin compatibility, automatic recovery and backups are not implemented. Screenplay formatting in the editor is a writing aid, not production pagination. Documents are limited to 20 MB. Save regularly.
